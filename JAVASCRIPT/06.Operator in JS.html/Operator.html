    <title>Operator in JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand. Operators are used to perform specific
        mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the
        operands. In JavaScript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc. There are
        various
        operators supported by JavaScript:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Operators</strong></li>
        <p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.</p>
        <P>
            +	Adds two numeric operands.
            -	Subtract right operand from left operand
            /	Divide left operand by right operand.
            %	Modulus operator. Returns remainder of two operands.
            ++	Increment operator. Increase operand value by one.
            --	Decrement operator. Decrease value by one.
            *	Multiply two numeric operands.
        </P>

        <li><strong>Comparison Operators</strong></li>
        <p>JavaScript provides comparison operators that compare two operands and return a boolean value true or false.</p>
        <p>
             ==	Compares the equality of two operands without considering type.
            ===	Compares equality of two operands with type.
            !=	Compares inequality of two operands.
            >	Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is greater than the right-side value;     otherwise, returns false.
            <	Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is less than the right-side value; otherwise, returns false.
            >=	Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is greater than or equal to the right-side value; otherwise, returns false.
            <=	Returns a boolean value true if the left-side value is less than or equal to the right-side value; otherwise, returns false.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Logical Operators</strong></li>
        <p>In JavaScript, the logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.</p>
        <p>
            &&	&& is known as AND operator. It checks whether two operands are non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero). It returns 1 if they are non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.
           ||	|| is known as OR operator. It checks whether any one of the two operands is non-zero or not (0, false, undefined, null or "" is considered as zero). It returns 1 if any one of of them is non-zero; otherwise, returns 0.
           !	! is known as NOT operator. It reverses the boolean result of the operand (or condition). !false returns true, and !true returns false.
        </p>

        
        <li><strong>Assignment Operators</strong></li>
        <p>JavaScript provides the assignment operators to assign values to variables with less key strokes.</p>
        <p>
             =	Assigns right operand value to the left operand.
            +=	Sums up left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
            -=	Subtract right operand value from the left operand value and assigns the result to the left operand.
            *=	Multiply left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
            /=	Divide left operand value by right operand value and assign the result to the left operand.
            %=	Get the modulus of left operand divide by right operand and assign resulted modulus to the left operand.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Ternary Operators</strong></li>
        <p>JavaScript provides a special operator called ternary operator :? that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. This is the short form of the if else condition.</p>
        
        <li><strong>typeof Operator</strong></li>
    </ul>
